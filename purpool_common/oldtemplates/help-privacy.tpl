<h3>Purpool Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>This policy describes how we collect, use, share, and protect your personal information. Protecting the privacy and security of your personal information is very important to us. Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do with the personal information we collect.</p>

<p>When you register for Purpool, any personal information you provide is voluntary. We collect and use only the minimum information necessary to faciliate the functionality of this site. For example we do not ask you for a home address as this is not necessary; your home zipcode is a good enough identifier for others who are interested in looking into carpooling with you. We collect your car data so that we can calculate your savings from carpooling.</p>


<h3>Where does your information go?</h3>
<h4>Within Purpool...</h4>
<ul> 
	<li>The information in your member profile is visible to other Purpool members who work at your workplace. </li>
    <li>If you join a pool information about your daily carpools will be visible to other members of the pool. Purpool members who are not in your pool will not be able to view this info.
</ul>
<h4>Outside of Purpool...</h4>
<ul> 
	<li>We do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies.</li>
    <li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</li>
    <li>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Purpool's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
</ul>
