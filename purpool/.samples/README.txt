=================================
Samples directory
================================

This folder is created on your account to provide you 
working examples of certain software and utilities
that we provide.

We reccomend keeping this folder in place so that
you always have working examples of the software.
When you want to make a customization to one of the 
provide examples, we reccomend that you copy the
example to another area of your account before
making any modifications.  This way you always have
a working reference in the event that something
becomes misconfigured.
