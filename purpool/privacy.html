<h2>What Does Purpool Do with Your Personal Information?
</h2>
<h2>— Our Privacy Policy — </h2>

<p>This policy describes how we collect, use, share, and protect your personal information. Protecting the privacy and security of your personal information is very important to us. Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do with the personal information we collect.</p>

<p>When you register for Purpool, any personal information you provide is voluntary. We collect and use only the minimum information necessary to faciliate the functionality of this site. For example we do not ask you for a home address as this is not necessary; your home zipcode is a good enough identifier for others who are interested in looking into carpooling with you. We collect your car data so that we can calculate your savings from carpooling.</p>
