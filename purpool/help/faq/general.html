<h2>General Purpool</h2>
<p>
<a name="1"><h3>What is Purpool?</h3>
</a> 
Purpool is a workplace based social networking site that 
centers on the commute and promotes ride-sharing as a community building 
activity. Participants have profiles and join carpool groups called pools. By making this program workplace-specific, we are building 
off already existing trust networks made up of people who share similar 
commuting patterns. Purpool was first conceived By Peter Ohring and Brooke Singer, faculty members in the New Media program at Purchase College, SUNY, in Purchase, NY, in 2006. The new version 
has a new design and a number of new features that we think will 
greatly help in facilitating ride-sharing including applications that will 
allow groups of people to coordinate their ride-shares and visualizations 
that will allow  individuals, groups and communities to see the amount of 
savings due to application use. These visualizations are important to give 
members a better understanding of how their behaviors have real consequences 
on large-scale problems like reduction of emissions and oil consumption. 
The development of this version of Purpool was supported by an award from NYSERDA (New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.)

<a name="2"><h3>Who can join Purpool?</h3></a> 
Purpool supports workplace based ride-sharing. Workplaces join the Purpool first. Employees can then register and begin using Purpool. To register you will need a working email address from a participating workplace.
</p>


<p>
<a name="3"><h3>What are the rules for using Purpool? </h3></a> 
<ul>
<li>If one member of the pool provides the car it is important for everyone to agree on reimbursement fees that include gas as well as wear and tear on the car. If driving is shared this is not needed.</li>
<li>Different people have different interests and driving habits. You should discuss and agree on some courtesy guidelines before carpooling with regard to music, smoking, and cell-phone use. </li>
<li>Plan pick-up and drop-off points carefully.</li>
<li>Use the Purpool ride confirm page to let your fellow carpoolers know whether you are participating in a ride.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="4"><h3>How can a new workplace join the Purpool Network?</h3></a> 
Purpool is currently being pilot tested at PepsiCo World Headquarters in Purchase, NY, Purchase College, also in Purchase, NY, and at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, ME. If your workplace would like to be part of the Purpool Network please email <a href="mailto:brooke.singer@purchase.edu">Brooke</a> or <a href="mailto:peter.ohring@purchase.edu">Peter</a>.
</p>


<p>
<a name="5"><h3>Can I use Purpool to carpool with a friend at another participating workplace?</h3>
</a> 
 At this time it is not poss bile for people from different workplaces to interact using Purpool. However, this is something we will be experimenting with in the near future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="6"><h3>I have a great idea for a new feature. How can I suggest it? </h3></a> 
Please use the form on the <a href="http://www.purpool.com/contact.php">Contact</a> page.</a>
</p>


<p>
<a name="7"><h3>What kind of system do I need for this site?</h3></a> 
Any computer with a recent version of Firefox, Internet Explorer or  Safari  is fine. Some visualizations require <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">Flash</a>.
